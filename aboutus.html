Through this website, we hope to shine a light on all the small business owners who put so much time, effort, and love into their shops. Especially during this pandemic, they need our help more than ever. Along with receiving outstanding customer service and high quality products, supporting these shops will also bring customers an immense sense of community and joy. Your support means the world to these shop owners, and by visiting our site, you are truly making a difference in your community. And for that, on behalf of all the small businesses out there, thank you! As Rembert Browne, a skilled culture critic at New York Magazine once stated, “These are establishments that are often the character of a neighborhood, a community. The relationships created between customers and those that work in independent business frequently go beyond just purchases — it becomes familial.”</p> <br>
